Micro Frontends: Scaling Your Teams And Architecture

Microservices have helped revolutionize how we build our backends. Gone are the
days of multiple development teams working on a single monolithic backend that
spans many domains with high coupling, bad scalability, slow feature
development, difficult merge conflicts, highly coordinated deployments, and the
like. Meanwhile, our frontends now face many of these same issues. Micro
frontend is the solution and future of frontend software development.

In this session, Jason will help demystify the micro frontend architecture
patterns. He will provide insights based on first-hand experience transitioning
a product away from a monolithic frontend over the past few years. Finally,
he’ll conclude with a live technical demo where he’ll build a micro frontend
architecture from scratch using Module Federation with Angular. By the end of
this session, you will realize that this isn’t as complicated as you may think.

This meetup is designed for:

Engineers and architects interested in learning more about scaling front-end
development efforts efficiently. Product Managers who are looking to learn about
organizing roadmaps and teams using micro frontend patterns. Technology leaders
and scrum/agile enthusiasts who are interested in scaling your front-end
development efforts while maintaining flexibility and speed.
